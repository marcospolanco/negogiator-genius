# Negotiator Genius

## Overview
Negotiator Genius is an innovative project developed for the genAI Hackathon. It's a chatbot designed to facilitate negotiations between organizations and their vendors or customers. The chatbot is capable of negotiating on behalf of the organization using cutting-edge technologies such as LangChain, Gradio, and GPT-4 Turbo as a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Key Features
- **Automated Negotiations:** Negotiator Genius automates the negotiation process, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Integration with LangChain:** LangChain technology enables the chatbot to understand and respond to negotiation scenarios effectively.
- **Gradio Interface:** The chatbot is accessible via a user-friendly Gradio interface, making it easy for users to interact with.
- **GPT-4 Turbo Integration:** Powered by GPT-4 Turbo, the chatbot provides intelligent responses and recommendations during negotiations.
- **Term Extraction:** Negotiator Genius can extract all negotiable terms from a contract, providing clarity and insight into the negotiation process.
- **Customizable Options:** It offers customizable options for vendors to choose from, empowering them to negotiate effectively against specific terms.

## How it Works
1. **Upload Contract:** Users upload the contract they wish to negotiate.
2. **Term Extraction:** The chatbot extracts all negotiable terms from the contract.
3. **Vendor Interaction:** Vendors interact with the chatbot through the Gradio interface, selecting the terms they want to negotiate against.
4. **Automated Negotiation:** Negotiator Genius initiates automated negotiations based on the selected terms, providing intelligent responses using GPT-4 Turbo.
5. **Negotiation Outcome:** The negotiation outcome is communicated to both parties, streamlining the negotiation process and ensuring transparency.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain:** Advanced language processing technology for understanding negotiation scenarios.
- **Gradio:** A user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **GPT-4 Turbo:** State-of-the-art language model for generating intelligent responses during negotiations.

## How to Use
1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.
2. **Run the Application:** Launch the Negotiator Genius application.
3. **Upload Contract:** Upload the contract you wish to negotiate.
4. **Interact with the Chatbot:** Interact with the chatbot through the Gradio interface, selecting terms for negotiation.
5. **Review Negotiation Outcome:** Review the negotiation outcome communicated by the chatbot.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced NLP Capabilities:** Further improve the chatbot's natural language processing capabilities to handle a wider range of negotiation scenarios.
- **Integration with External Systems:** Integrate Negotiator Genius with external systems and platforms to streamline the negotiation process.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implement advanced analytics features to provide insights into negotiation trends and outcomes.
- **Multi-Lingual Support:** Add support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
